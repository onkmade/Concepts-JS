# Arrow Function

Arrow functions are a modern, shorter way to write functions in JavaScript, mainly used when you want clean and simple code. They don't have their own `this` or `arguments`, which makes them perfect for callbacks in events, array methods, and promises because they behave more predictably. Overall, they make your code shorter, clearer, and easier to read in most everyday situations.

## Basic Syntax
The basic syntax of an arrow function is as follows:
```javascript
const functionName = (parameters) => {
    // code to be executed
};
```
If there is only one parameter, you can omit the parentheses:
```javascript
const square = num => {
    return num * num;
};
```
If the function body has only one expression, you can omit the curly braces and the `return` keyword:
```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(add(2, 3)); // Outputs: 5
```


### Understanding: 

Arrow function **syntax** says that a function can be written in a shorter, cleaner form using `=>`.
It removes the need for the `function` keyword and often removes the need for `return` and `{ }`.

Example of the syntax rule:

```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

Meaning:

* Put parameters inside `()`
* Write `=>`
* Then write the result or the function body

Arrow function syntax is mainly about **shorter, simpler function writing**.
