# Function

Functions are used everywhere in web development:
handling button clicks, validating forms, toggling dark mode, fetching data, updating UI, running calculations, literally everything. Once you understand functions, JavaScript will suddenly feel more structured and powerful.

Basic structure of a function:
```javascript
function functionName(parameters) {
    // code to be executed
}
```
