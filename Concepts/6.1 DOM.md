# DOM (Document Object Model)

In JavaScript, everything in the DOM (Document Object Model) is built around objects.

The browser gives you a global object called `document` that represents the entire HTML page.

This `document` object has many built-in methods like `getElementById()`, `querySelector()`, and `createElement()`.

These are methods because they are functions attached to the `document` object.

When you select an element, like `const btn = document.getElementById("myButton");`, the variable `btn` now holds a reference to an HTML element object.

That element object has its own properties (like `id`, `textContent`, `style`) and methods (like `click()`, `addEventListener()`).

One useful property of an element object is `classList`, which itself is another object (a DOMTokenList).

The `classList` object has methods such as `add()`, `remove()`, `toggle()`, and `contains()`.

So `btn.classList.add("active")` means: on the `btn` object → access its `classList` property (an object) → call the `add` method on that object.

This chaining of objects and methods is how the DOM works: objects contain properties, some properties are objects themselves, and those can have methods.

```javascript
// Example chain
document                  // global object
  .querySelector("button") // method → returns element object
  .classList               // property → DOMTokenList object
  .add("highlight");       // method on classList
```

In short: DOM gives you objects → objects have properties and methods → some properties are objects with their own methods → this structure lets you manipulate the webpage easily.
