# Object destructuring

Object destructuring is a modern JavaScript feature (ES6+) that lets you extract values from objects and assign them to variables in a clean, concise way.
Instead of accessing properties one by one, you "unpack" them directly.

Basic example:

You have an object:

```js
const person = {
  name: "Kiuru",
  age: 21,
  city: "Helsinki"
};
```

Without destructuring, you’d write:

```js
const name = person.name;
const age = person.age;
const city = person.city;
```

With **object destructuring**, you do it in one line:

```js
const { name, age, city } = person;

console.log(name);  // "Kiuru"
console.log(age);   // 21
```

The curly braces `{}` on the left tell JavaScript: "pull out these properties from the object on the right and create variables with the same names."

You can rename variables if needed:

```js
const { name: fullName, age: yearsOld } = person;

console.log(fullName);  // "Kiuru"
console.log(yearsOld);  // 21
```

This is super common with function returns, like in our quote generator:

```js
function getRandomQuote() {
  return { text: "Hello world", author: "Me" };
}

const { text, author } = getRandomQuote();
console.log(text);    // "Hello world"
console.log(author);  // "Me"
```

You can also set default values (in case a property is missing):

```js
const { name, country = "Finland" } = person;
console.log(country);  // "Finland" (used default if missing)
```

Or destructure nested objects:

```js
const user = {
  profile: {
    name: "Kiuru",
    location: { city: "Helsinki" }
  }
};

const { profile: { name, location: { city } } } = user;
console.log(city);  // "Helsinki"
```

In web development, you'll see destructuring everywhere—especially with props in React, API responses, or event objects.
It makes your code shorter, clearer, and less repetitive.
